## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

### Free-First Approach
Every tool and service used in this curriculum is free:
- **No paid APIs** - Gemini free tier provides 60 requests per minute
- **No paid hosting** - Streamlit Cloud and Hugging Face Spaces offer free hosting
- **No paid databases** - SQLite and FAISS provide free storage solutions
- **No paid development tools** - Python ecosystem provides all necessary libraries

### Progressive Complexity
Each project introduces new concepts while reinforcing previous learning:
- **Week 1-3:** Basic API calls and simple UIs
- **Week 4-6:** Multi-step workflows and data processing
- **Week 7-9:** Production features and advanced AI techniques
- **Week 10-12:** Cutting-edge techniques and real-world applications

### Portfolio Building
Every project is designed to be portfolio-worthy:
- **Deployable applications** that can be shared publicly
- **Real-world use cases** that demonstrate practical value
